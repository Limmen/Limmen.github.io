abstract="We formulate intrusion tolerance for a system with service replicas as a two-level game: a local game models intrusion recovery and a global game models replication control. For both games, we prove the existence of equilibria and show that the best responses have a threshold structure, which enables efficient computation of strategies. State-of-the-art intrusion-tolerant systems can be understood as instantiations of our game with heuristic control strategies. Our analysis shows the conditions under which such heuristics can be significantly improved through game-theoretic reasoning. This reasoning allows us to derive the optimal control strategies and evaluate them against 10 types of network intrusions on a testbed. The testbed results demonstrate that our game-theoretic strategies can significantly improve service availability and reduce the operational cost of state-of-the-art intrusion-tolerant systems. In addition, our game strategies can ensure any chosen level of service availability and time-to-recovery, bridging the gap between theoretical and operational performance.",
